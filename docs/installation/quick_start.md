# Quick Start

!!!note "System requirements"
    With the low-resolution settings, PyPSA-China-PIK will run on a local machine or laptop. Solving a full year at hourly resolution will require a high performance cluster or server with around 50GB of RAM - depending on your settings.

## Installation

1. **Install the [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) package manager** 

    It may be possible to run the workflow with a better manager such as `uv` but it will not work out of the box

    === "Unix/MacOs/WSL"

        !!!note "Conda tips"

            Conda is a rather large install with a GUI and features not required by PyPSA-China. You may prefer to use the lighter miniconda, which is our recommendation. 
            
            You can check whether you already have conda with `which anaconda` or `which conda`. Newer condas have a faster dependcy solver - as the package is rather large we strongly recommend you update to `v> 2024.10`.

    === "Windows"

        !!!note "Conda tips"

            You can check whether you already have conda with `where anaconda` or `where conda`. Newer condas have a faster dependcy solver - as the package is rather large we strongly recommend you update to `v> 2024.9`.


2. **Setup the environment**: This can take a long time 

    === "Unix/MacOS/WSL"
        ```bash title="install dependencies"
        cd <workflow_location>
        conda env create --file=workflow/envs/environment.yaml
        ```

3. **Activate environment**

    === "Unix/MacOS/WSL"
        ```bash title="activate environment"
        source activate pypsa-china
        ```
    === "Windows"
        ```bash title="activate environment"
        conda activate pypsa-china
        ```
        
4. **Fetch data**


    === "Automatic download (slow)"

        !!!note "Commands"
            ```bash
            cd my_repository_clone
            conda activate pypsa-china
            snakemake --configfile examples/fetch_data.yaml
            ```

            if running locally you may need to add `--cores 1`


    === "Manual download (faster)"

        !!!note "Sources"
            Manually fetch the data (faster but requires copy-pasting): https://zenodo.org/records/16810831

            Destinations are in `resources/data` folders (rasters, cutouts, existing infrastructure).

            A back-up data source is the PyPSA-China paper https://zenodo.org/records/13987282

5. **Install a Solver**: e.g. [gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) [HiGHS](https://highs.dev/) or cplex. The current default configuration uses gurobi.
6. **[Run locally](../../Tutorials/running/#local_exec)**


## Testing the installation

=== "Unix/MacOS/WSL"
    ```bash title="Test install"
    source activate pypsa-china
    cd <workflow_location>
    pytest tests/integration
    ```
=== "Windows"
    ```bat title="Test install"
    conda activate pypsa-china
    cd <workflow_location>
    pytest tests/integration
    ```
