# Summary 
Open-source energy system models are essential for understanding and planning future energy systems, as well as for providing a transparent knowledge basis for evidence-based decision-making [@pfenningerImportanceOpenData2017]. Yet, such open-source, open-data models remain scarce for China. To fill this gap, we present `PyPSA-China-PIK`  - a fully open-source, open-data model of China's current and future power sector. The model co-optimizes investments in electricity generation, storage and grid transmission capacity, together with their dispatch to minimize the total cost of supplying electricity and other energy carriers. Optimization is subject to user-defined constraints including environmental –policies such as carbon prices or emissions budgets,   as well as operational reserve margins to ensure system reliability.

`PyPSA-China-PIK` operates at high spatio-temporal resolution, enabling accurate assessment of the benefits, challenges and solutions  associated with high shares of variable renewable energy. Uniquely , the model can incorporate results such as capacity expansion decisions from the [REMIND](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/departments/transformation-pathways/models/remind ) [@baumstarkREMIND2021]  Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) as input data. This coupling improves the plausibility of long-term transition pathways.

The  model uses the PyPSA framework [@PyPSA] and builds upon previously published work[@zhouMultienergySystemHorizon2024] but incorporates significant upgrades - e.g. to renewable energy generation and power reserves -  and has been restructured to support ease of use and community development .

# Statement of need
Internationally agreed climate targets, combined with declining costs and rapid deployment of renewable energy generation and storage, are fundamentally transforming electricity systems worldwide. This is especially true for China - the world's largest power system, biggest greenhouse gas emitter and global leader in renewable energy installations. Open and transparent modeling is essential to identify opportunities, bottlenecks and challenges in a non-partisan manner . Yet, most studies rely on expensive commercial software (e.g. PLEXOS [@abhyankarAchieving80Carbonfree2022]) or proprietary code (sometimes available on request) and/or data ([@zhuoCostIncreaseElectricity2022], [@heRapidCostDecrease2020], [@luoCosteffectivenessRemovingLast2025])

To the best of the authors’ knowledge, only three fully-open models of China’s power system currently exist, each with provincial resolution. `SWITCH-China`[@heSWITCHChinaSystemsApproach2016a] derives medium-term pathways with limited temporal detail (two typical days of 6 hour-long time slices per month). The related `CHEER/power` works similarly but has the advantage that long-term demand projections are generated by the CHEER macro-economic model[@anRepositioningCoalPower2025]. Seasonal storage is, however, not implemented . Neither model covers heat, which is strongly coupled to electricity generation through important combined-heat-and-power capacities in Northern China. This coupling can act as a coal lock-in [@liuDiversifyingHeatSources2024]. `PyPSA-China` [@zhouMultienergySystemHorizon2024], models full years of 8760 hours of the year and covers heat and electricity. Investment periods can be linked sequentially with “myopic foresight” .  Despite these solid foundations, `PyPSA-China` has limitations, which are addressed by the following improvements in the newer `PyPSA-China-PIK` 
-	**Operational reserves for contingency planning**
-	**Sub-provincial representation of renewable generator capacity and availability**: this avoids smoothing of profiles and capacity factors over very large areas
-	**Fully configurable**: no hard-coded variables, all modes and options controlled by `yaml` configs.
-	**Extensive reporting**: comprehensive analysis and plotting methods for the spatial, economics and temporal results, including impact of constraints
-	**Coupling [interface](https://github.com/pik-piam/Remind-PyPSA-coupling) to long-term Integrated Assessment models    ** (REMIND) for improved pathway plausibility
-	**Data pipelines**: increased source transparency, flexible data replacement and updated defaults. 
-	Added existing combined heat-and-power coal plants to model
-	**Community use focus**: addition of documentation and example configurations to help modelers get started. Code-base streamlined and refocused for collaborative development 
-	**Quality assurance**: automated tests and code formatting/audits. 


# Model Overview
![overview of the `PyPSA-China-PIK` workflow](figures/rules_graph_simplified.pdf)
`PyPSA-China-PIK`    is best understood as a workflow built on-top of the Python Power System Analysis ([PyPSA](https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)) modeling framework[@PyPSA]. The four steps  are: 

1.	Data fetch of open energy systems (existing power system infrastructure, weather and land-use) data.
2.	Preparation of a PyPSA least-cost linear optimization problem
3.	Solve with the user’s preferred solver (e.g. Gurobi or HigHS)
4.	Post-process: Analysing & reporting the solution


## Key data
-	Load: the NDRC ministry published provincial peak-valley daily demand data and typical day profiles for each province. This limits the spatial network resolution to 31  nodes, which is sufficient for long-term capacity expansion planning (e.g [@wuHourlyElectricPower2023]).
-	Weather data is collected from ECMWF’s ERA5 by `atlite`[@atlite2021]. Renewable potentials and hourly availability are aggregated by capacity factor at sub-provincial resolution.
-	Land-use availability: is obtained from the Copernicus land classification survey[@GlobalDynamicLand]
-	Existing power plant capacities are from the Global Energy Monitor Integrated Power Tracke[@GlobalIntegratedPower2025].



# Functionalities  
The core `PyPSA-China-PIK` functionalities are:
- Co-optimisation of dispatch and investment for electricity generation, transmission and storage down to hourly resolution for a full year for all 31 Chinese mainland provinces and regions.
- Greenfield and brownfield energy systems
- Modelling of renewable availability using the `atlite` package [@atlite2021]. Aggregation by capacity factor at sub-node resolution, which is essential for large provinces such as Inner Mongolia.
- Modelling of hydroelectricity based on `atlite` and dam cascades[@liuRoleHydroPower2019].
- Co-optimisation of electricity and heat. Heat storage, production and combined heat-and-power generation can be included. There is flexibility to add further energy carriers and loads such as electric vehicles as done in PyPSA-EUR [REF].
-  Transition pathways: myopic [#TODO] or informed by IAM scenario results

## Pathways  
An advanced feature is the ability to incorporate transformation pathways from the REMIND integrated assessment model [@baumstarkREMIND2021] as input data, reflecting long-term demand and investment trends, and evolution of techno-economic parameters, such as endogenously declining solar photovoltaics costs, including endogenous cost-decreases from learning. This allows embedding the detailed assessment of power system variability, flexibility, and reliability into long-term pathways consistent with climate targets.

# Validation
Unlike in our model, power dispatch in China is not currently based on least-cost principles[@xiangAssessingRolesEfficient2023].  Nonetheless, `PyPSA-China-PIK` is able to reproduce historical data with high accuracy (figure 2). A key difference concerns gas power, which the model does not select for dispatch due to its high fuel costs. This has been noted by others [@xiangAssessingRolesEfficient2023]. The choice of gas is usually linked to PM2.5 emission reduction efforts in densely populated areas [@liuDiversifyingHeatSources2024].
