  abstract = {Dramatic reductions in solar, wind, and battery storage costs create new opportunities to reduce emissions and costs in China's electricity sector, beyond current policy goals. This study examines the cost, reliability, emissions, public health, and employment implications of increasing the share of non-fossil fuel (``carbon free'') electricity generation in China to 80\% by 2035. The analysis uses state-of-the-art modeling with high resolution load, wind, and solar inputs. The study finds that achieving an 80\% carbon-free electricity system in China by 2035 could reduce wholesale electricity costs, relative to a current policy baseline, while maintaining high levels of reliability, reducing deaths from air pollution, and increasing employment. In our 80\% scenario, wind and solar generation capacity reach 3 TW and battery storage capacity reaches 0.4 TW by 2035, implying a rapid scale up in these resources that will require changes in policy targets, markets and regulation, and land use policies.},

Using a provincial-level, hourly-dispatched power system model of China that incorporates intertemporal decisions on early retirement and carbon capture retrofitting, our study reveals that for coal-rich but gas-poor economies, repositioning coal power from a baseload resource to a flexibility provider can accelerate net-zero transition of the power system in three aspects. First, when achieving the same emissions reduction target, it mitigates stranded assets by decreasing the average lifespan loss of coal power by 7.9-9.6 years and enhancing the long-term competitiveness of retrofitted coal power. Second, it enables the integration of an additional 194-245 gigawatts of variable renewables by 2030 under the same carbon emissions reduction trajectory. Third, it reduces China's power system transition costs by approximately 176 billion U.S. Dollars, particularly in the face of costly gas power and energy storage technologies. These robust findings underscore the need for appropriate policies to incentivize the flexible dispatch, orderly retirement, and carbon capture retrofitting of coal power, thereby accelerating the decarbonization of China's power system.},

REMIND, as an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM), provides an integrated view on the global energy-economy-emissions system and explores self-consistent transformation pathways. It describes a broad range of possible futures and their relation to technical and socio-economic developments as well as policy choices. REMIND is a multi-regional model incorporating the economy and a detailed representation of the energy sector implemented in the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). It uses non-linear optimization to derive welfare-optimal regional transformation pathways of the energy-economic system subject to climate and sustainability constraints for the time horizon 2005 to 2100. The resulting solution corresponds to the decentral market outcome under the assumptions of perfect foresight of agents and internalization of external effects. REMIND enables analyses of technology options and policy approaches for climate change mitigation with particular strength in representing the scale-up of new technologies, including renewables and their integration in power markets. The REMIND code is organized into modules that gather code relevant for specific topics. Interaction between different modules is made explicit via clearly defined sets of input/output variables. Each module can be represented by different realizations enabling flexible configuration and extension. The spatial resolution of REMIND is flexible and depends on the resolution of the input data. The framework can thus be used for a variety of applications in a customized form balancing requirements for detail and overall run-time and complexity.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, the integration of wind energy into China's coal-heavy electricity system presents significant challenges owing to wind's variability and the grid's system-wide inflexibilities. Here we develop a model to predict how much wind energy can be generated and integrated into China's electricity mix, and estimate a potential production of 2.6~petawatt-hours (PWh) per year in 2030. Although this represents 26\% of total projected electricity demand, it is only 10\% of the total estimated physical potential of wind resources in the country. Increasing the operational flexibility of China's coal fleet would allow wind to deliver nearly three-quarters of China's target of producing 20\% of primary energy from non-fossil sources by 2030.},

Results indicate that grid integration barriers exist currently at the provincial level. For 2030, optimized offshore wind investment levels should be doubled compared with current government plans, and provincial allocations should be significantly improved considering both resource quality and grid conditions. For 2050, offshore wind capacity in China could reach as high as 1500\,GW, prompting a paradigm shift in national transmission structure, favoring long-term storage in the energy portfolio, enabling green hydrogen production in coastal demand centers, resulting in the world's largest wind power market.},

The co-benefits of carbon-price strategy would offset 22\% to 42\% of the increased electricity costs if the true cost of coal and the social cost of carbon are incorporated. In such a scenario, aggressive attention to research and both technological and financial innovation mechanisms are crucial to enabling the transition at a reasonable cost, along with strong carbon policies.},

Here we find that replacing polluting coal technologies with new and improved coal-fired combined heat and power plants will lead to substantial carbon lock-in and hinder decommissioning of associated coal-fired electricity generation. Expanding the use of industrial waste heat and air/ground-source heat pumps can avoid the need for new combined heat and power construction and reduce carbon emissions by 26\% from 2020 to 2030.

  abstract = {Deep decarbonization of the electricity sector can be provided by a high penetration of renewable sources such as wind, solar PV and hydro power. Flexibility from hydro and storage complements the high temporal variability of wind and solar, and transmission infrastructure helps the power balancing by moving electricity in the spatial dimension. We study cost-optimal highly-renewable Chinese power systems under ambitious CO2 emission reduction targets, by deploying a 31-node hourly-resolved technoeconomic optimization model supported by a validated weather-converted 38-year-long renewable power generation and electricity demand dataset. With a new realistic reservoir hydro model, we find that if CO2 emission reduction goes beyond 70\%, storage facilities such as hydro, battery and hydrogen become necessary for a moderate system cost. Numerical results show that these flexibility components can lower renewable curtailment by two thirds, allow higher solar PV share by a factor of two and contribute to covering summer cooling demand. We show that expanding unidirectional high-voltage DC lines on top of the regional inter-connections is technically sufficient and more economical than ultra-high-voltageAC-connected "One-Net" grid. Finally, constraining transmission volume from the optimum by up to 25\% does not push total costs much higher, while the significant need for battery storage remains even with abundant interconnectivity.},

While existing studies highlight the technological complexities, flexibility challenges, and cost implications of achieving carbon neutrality, mitigating the last 10\%--20\% of power system emissions in China has not been sufficiently addressed. Here, we estimate the impacts of eliminating the last 10\%--20\% of CO2 emissions on new capacity, the transmission network, system costs, and climate and public health benefits. We find that although system costs slightly increase (less than 1\%) under deep decarbonization in China, climate and health benefits are substantial. We further investigate the role of three important emission mitigation technologies (nuclear, offshore wind, and carbon capture and storage) in power system deep decarbonization. Our analysis shows that none of these technologies would significantly affect future system costs but they influence both the quantity and location of renewable energy installations and the expansion of China's transmission network. With China's power system, the world's largest, we demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of achieving a net-zero electricity sector and offer insights on implications for renewable development and transmission expansion when prioritizing decarbonization technologies.},

  abstract = {Macro-energy system modelling is used by decision-makers to steer the global energy transition towards an affordable, sustainable and reliable future. Closed-source models are the current standard for most policy and industry decisions. However, open models have proven to be competitive alternatives that promote science, robust technical analysis, collaboration and transparent policy decision-making. Yet, two issues slow the adoption: open models are often designed with particular geographic scope in mind, thus hindering synergies from collaborating, or are based on low spatially resolved data, limiting their use. Here we introduce PyPSA-Earth, an open-source global energy system model with data in high spatial and temporal resolution. It enables large-scale collaboration by providing a tool that can model the world's energy system or any subset of it. The model is suitable for operational as well as combined generation, storage and transmission expansion studies. In this study, the novel power system capabilities of PyPSA-Earth are highlighted and demonstrated. The model provides two main features: (1) customizable data extraction and preparation with global coverage and (2) a PyPSA energy modelling framework integration. The data includes electricity demand, generation and medium to high-voltage networks from open sources, yet additional data can be further integrated. A broad range of clustering and grid meshing strategies help adapt the model to computational and practical needs. Data validation for the entire African continent is performed and the optimization features are tested with a 2060 net-zero planning study for Nigeria. The demonstration shows that the presented developments can build a highly detailed power system model for energy planning studies to support policy and technical decision-making. We anticipate that PyPSA-Earth can represent an open reference model for system planning, and we welcome joining forces to address the challenges of the energy transition together.},

Pumped hydro storage (PHS) can play a crucial role in power system decarbonization by providing both short- and long-term energy storage, facilitating the integration of variable renewable energy and maintaining grid stability. However, there is a lack of systematic assessment of how much PHS is needed to support the stability and reliability of a zero-carbon power system. Here we use a high-resolution power system planning model to investigate the role of PHS. Our findings indicate that building excessive PHS may not be the most cost-effective path to achieve zero-carbon power system, if there is no major cost reduction of PHS. A planned capacity of 120\,GW of PHS is already sufficient to balance electricity supply and demand by 2050, since battery storage capacity is projected to substantially increase between 2025 and 2050 and is emerging as a more economical solution to address the variability of renewable energy and accommodate demand growth. Our results suggest that over-investment in PHS could lead to unnecessary electricity price inflation. Further improvement of business models for energy storage in China's evolving electricity market is critical to facilitating the rapid and sustainable development of energy storage in a decarbonizing China's power system.},

  abstract = {China has pledged for their carbon emissions to have peaked by 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. However, this requires restructuring of their entire energy system. This study establishes a bottom-up low-carbon transition model for electric and heating coupled systems. The power system's adequacy with high penetration of renewable energy is considered via an iterative calculation approach, the layout of the power and heat system and the future of coal power under carbon emission constraints are discussed. Different from other research, our results show that the capacity of coal power would further increase to support a reliable transition of power system towards a higher proportion of renewable electricity, and the current target of 1200~GW of wind and solar in 2030 is not enough to achieve rapid carbon reductions, and would result in an extra 1.6 to 2.2 billion t CO2 emitted compared to 2020. Achieving 50\% of non-fossil electricity generation by 2030 is feasible, and the target needs to be raised to 1660~to 1850~GW at only 3\% increase of total cost. Not building new coal power plants would result in a huge expansion of electricity storage in China, which is hard to realize because of extremely high investment cost.},

  abstract = {China began implementing market-based economic dispatch through power sector reform in 2015, but the reform has encountered some political and economic challenges. Here we identify the reform's efficiency changes and explore the influences of market-driven and politically driven mechanisms behind them. We do this through a cost-minimizing dispatch model integrating high-frequency data in southern China. We find that the dispatch transition improves the overall efficiency, but regulatory capture in provincial markets limits its full potential. The preference for local enterprises over central state-owned enterprises (SOEs) by local governments, in the form of allocated generation quotas, demonstrates the political challenge for market reform. The allocated generation quota protects small coal-fired and natural gas generators owned by local SOEs, lessening their motivation to improve generation efficiency, even after the reform. As a result, nearly half of the potential carbon dioxide emissions reduction and social welfare gains through market reform is not realized.},

  abstract = {China has committed to achieve net carbon neutrality by 2060 to combat global climate change, which will require unprecedented deployment of negative emissions technologies, renewable energies (RE), and complementary infrastructure. At terawatt-scale deployment, land use limitations interact with operational and economic features of power systems. To address this, we developed a spatially resolved resource assessment and power systems planning optimization that models a full year of power system operations, sub-provincial RE siting criteria, and transmission connections. Our modeling results show that wind and solar must be expanded to 2,000 to 3,900 GW each, with one plausible pathway leading to 300 GW/yr combined annual additions in 2046 to 2060, a three-fold increase from today. Over 80\% of solar and 55\% of wind is constructed within 100 km of major load centers when accounting for current policies regarding land use. Large-scale low-carbon systems must balance key trade-offs in land use, RE resource quality, grid integration, and costs. Under more restrictive RE siting policies, at least 740 GW of distributed solar would become economically feasible in regions with high demand, where utility-scale deployment is limited by competition with agricultural land. Effective planning and policy formulation are necessary to achieve China's climate goals.},

  abstract = {An appropriate decarbonisation pathway is crucial to achieving carbon neutrality in China before 2060. This paper studies decarbonisation pathways for China's energy system between 2020 and 2060 using an open, provincial, and hourly resolved, networked model within the context of multi-period planning with myopic investment foresight. Two representative decarbonisation pathways are compared, with particular attention to the synergies of coupling the electricity and heating sectors. An early and steady path in which emissions are strongly reduced in the first decade is more cost-effective than following a late and rapid path. Early decarbonisation in the electricity sector avoids stranded investments in fossil infrastructure and preserves the carbon budget for later emissions in the difficult-to-decarbonise heating sector. Retrofitting the existing coal power plants by adding carbon capture facilities is cost-effective in both decarbonisation pathways. The hourly and non-interrupted resolution for a full weather year reveals the balancing strategies of highly renewable, sector-coupled systems. The significant seasonal variation of heat demand dominates long-term storage behaviours.},

  abstract = {The Chinese government has set long-term carbon neutrality and renewable energy (RE) development goals for the power sector. Despite a precipitous decline in the costs of RE technologies, the external costs of renewable intermittency and the massive investments in new RE capacities would increase electricity costs. Here, we develop a power system expansion model to comprehensively evaluate changes in the electricity supply costs over a 30-year transition to carbon neutrality. RE supply curves, operating security constraints, and the characteristics of various generation units are modelled in detail to assess the cost variations accurately. According to our results, approximately 5.8\,TW of wind and solar photovoltaic capacity would be required to achieve carbon neutrality in the power system by 2050. The electricity supply costs would increase by 9.6 CNY¢/kWh. The major cost shift would result from the substantial investments in RE capacities, flexible generation resources, and network expansion.},
